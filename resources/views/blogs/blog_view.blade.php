                        <p>Coaching is a pivotal part of CA
                            preparation. However, the pandemic has held the world into its grip, forcing us
                            all to stay in. There is no sign of educational institutions reopening anytime
                            soon. But we cannot add a comma in educating the young minds, can we? Thus, CA
                            coaching classes have started offering video lectures now.</p>
                        <p>So, are these online video
                            lectures enough for students trying to crack one of the highest regarded exams?
                            Well, pre-recorded online lectures can be one of the best things that happen to
                            CA aspirants. And here's why:</p>
                        <h2>Saves Travelling Time And Cost</h2>
                        <p>The online mode of education
                            allows students to study remotely. With the traditional way of classroom
                            learning, students were compelled to spend a great deal of time and money on
                            travelling. And some people travel from faraway places. Pre-recorded online CA
                            lectures enable you to study at the comfort of your home. Studying for CA
                            demands a lot of time from students, and video lectures give you some extra
                            prep hours. </p>
                        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
                        <p>Students from any location can
                            have access to coaching via pre-recorded lectures, provided they have a decent
                            internet connection.<b></b>They can
                            study from any place and at any time. Many students complain that their
                            regular, college lectures clash with CA coaching. Online classes for CA allow
                            them to juggle both college and the CA course effortlessly. One can study early
                            in the morning or late at night. Online classes provide the best flexibility of
                            place and time to the students.</p>
                        <p>At JK Shah, our video classes
                            for CA are available for students through our online portal. We offer them
                            assistance in preparing an efficient study schedule, and conduct regular tests.
                            The lectures are pre-recorded by our qualified and experienced tutors who
                            provide quality coaching to students.</p>
                        <h2>Revise the Lectures Multiple times</h2>
                        <p>One of the best things about
                            pre-recorded lectures is that students can watch them multiple times. This
                            helps them to revise better and have access to lectures any time they need.
                            While watching the pre-recorded lectures, students can pause and rewind to
                            understand concepts slowly. This is one of the benefits that only pre-recorded
                            online lectures can give. With live lectures on the other hand, the pace at
                            which the teacher explains can either be too fast or too slow. Another downside
                            of live online lectures is that they can be easily interrupted through poor
                            internet connection. </p>
                        <h2>Enhanced Learning Experience</h2>
                        <p>Pre-recorded lectures
                            incorporate other media such as clips, videos, and images through web links.
                            This provides students with more study material, notes, articles, and other
                            information related to their subjects. With animated clips and videos, learning
                            becomes much easier and practical. It does not bore the students easily and
                            keeps them engaged in learning.</p>
                        <p>With all the above-mentioned
                            benefits of online classes, students must remember that they need to be
                            self-motivated to carry out their own schedule on time. Determination to learn
                            is something that comes from within. Unless the student is not willing to work
                            hard, the availability of online lectures might not benefit them.</p>
                        <p>We, at JK Shah, offer CA online crash courses
                            through pre-recorded lectures. Students can also prepare for CA final and CA
                            intermediate courses with the help of our lectures online. The young CA
                            aspirants also have the option of opting for just a specific group, subject,
                            and chapter. We give our students the option for streaming lectures on any
                            device and learning in the language of their choice for better understanding.</p>
