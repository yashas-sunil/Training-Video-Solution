                            <p>2.	Terms of Use for Site, Application or Services</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0">2.1.	Accounts
                            You need an account for most activities on our website. Keep your password somewhere safe, because you’re responsible for all activity associated with your account. If you suspect someone else is using your account, let us know by contacting us. You must have reached the age of consent for online services in India to use online.jkshahclasses.com.</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0">You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account. If you contact us to request access to an account, we will not grant you such access unless you can provide us with the information that we need to prove you are the owner of that account. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be closed.
                            </p> <p class="pl-4 pt-0">You may not share your account login credentials with anyone else. You are responsible for what happens with your account and JKSC will not intervene in disputes between students or instructors who have shared account login credentials. You must notify us immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission (or if you suspect any other breach of security) by contacting us. We may request some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of your account.</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0">Students and instructors must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on JKSC and use the Services. If you are younger than 18 but above the required age for consent to use online services where you live, you may not set up an account, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an account and help you enroll in courses that are appropriate for you. If you are below this age of consent to use online services, you may not create a JKSC account. If we discover that you have created an account that violates these rules, we will terminate your account.</p>

                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0"> 2.2.	Course Enrollment and Access
                            When you enroll in a course, you get a license from us to view it via the JKSC Services and no other use. Don’t try to transfer or resell courses in any way. We grant you an exclusive access license, except when we must disable the course because of legal or policy reasons.</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0">As a student, when you enroll in a course, whether it’s a free or paid course, you are getting a license from JKSC to view the course via the JKSC platform and Services, and JKSC is the licensor of record. Courses are licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the course in any manner (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the course and sharing it on torrent sites).</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0">In legal, more complete terms, JKSC grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the courses and associated content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non-commercial, educational purposes through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions associated with a particular courses or feature of our Services. All other uses are expressly prohibited. You may not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any course unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written agreement signed by a JKSC authorized representative. This also applies to content you can access via any of our APIs.</p>

                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0"> We reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use courses at any point in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to a course due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course you enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if we determine its content violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines.
                            </p> <p class="pl-4 pt-0">Instructors may not grant licenses to the courses to students directly, and any such direct license shall be null and void and a violation of these Terms.</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0"> 2.3.	Content and Behaviour Rules</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0">You can only use JKSC for lawful purposes. You’re responsible for all the content that you post on our platform. You should keep the reviews, questions, posts, courses and other content you upload in line with our Trust & Safety Guidelines and the law, and respect the intellectual property rights of others. We can ban your account for repeated or major offenses. If you think someone is infringing your copyright on our platform, let us know.

Further, you agree not to upload any content or technology (including information on encryption) whose export is specially controlled under the Export Administration Regulations or other applicable regulations.</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0">If you are a student, the Services may enable you to ask questions to the instructors of courses you are enrolled in, and to post reviews of courses. For certain courses, the instructor may invite you to submit content as “homework” or tests. Don’t post or submit anything that is not yours.</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0"> If we are put on notice that your content and behaviour violates the law or the rights of others (for example, if it is established that it violates intellectual property or image rights of others, or is about an illegal activity), if we discover that your content or behaviour violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines, or if we believe your content or behaviour is unlawful, inappropriate, or objectionable (for example if you impersonate someone else), we may remove your access from our platform.</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0">JKSC has discretion in enforcing these Terms and our Trust & Safety Guidelines. We may terminate or suspend your permission to use our platform and Services or ban your account at any time, with or without notice, for any or no reason, including for any violation of these Terms, if you fail to pay any fees when due, upon the request of law enforcement or government agencies, for extended periods of inactivity, for unexpected technical issues or problems, or if we suspect that you engage in fraudulent or illegal activities, or for any other reason in our sole discretion. Upon any such termination we may delete your account and content, and we may prevent you from further access to the platforms and use of our Services. Your content may still be available on the platforms even if your account is terminated or suspended. You agree that we will have no liability to you or any third party for termination of your account, removal of your content, or blocking of your access to our platforms and services.</p>
                            <p class="pl-4 pt-0"> If one of our instructors has published a course that infringes your copyright or trademark rights, please let us know. Our Instructor Terms require our instructors to follow the law and respect the intellectual property rights of others. For more details on how to file a copyright or trademark infringement claim with us, see our Intellectual Property Policy.</p>
